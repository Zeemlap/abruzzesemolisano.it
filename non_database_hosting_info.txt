WINDOWS HOSTING MANAGEMENT
Absolute path of the website folder: d:\inetpub\webs\nomedominioxxx
the "domainnamexxx" string must be replaced by the name of the domain (without the www) and its extension, without the "." character between the name of the domain and the extension.

If you need to indicate the path in a php script the “\”character must be replaced with “//”;
If you need to indicate the path in a perl script the “\”character must be replaced with “/”; 

Upon activation, the following folders with specific proprieties are created within the web space:

cgi-bin : this folder can hold executable files like cgi and others alike. It does not have writing permissions.

public : this folder can hold all the files on which all users must be able to write. It is usually used to hold the counter files, forums or other scripts which need to write in the archive files.

mdb-database : has the same characteristics as the public folder, but its content cannot be "downloaded". It is suitable for holding mdb database files on which asp pages can "work" and write.

app_data: has the same characteristics as the mdb-database folder and is created to use the potential offered by the .NET Framework 3.5/4.0

The default.asp file is the "Under Construction" temporary page and can be easily deleted or edited.
